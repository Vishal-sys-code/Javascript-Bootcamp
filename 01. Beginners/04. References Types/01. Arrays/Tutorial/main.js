/* 
-------------------- ARRAYS --------------------
- An array is an object that can store multiple values at once.

Object allow you to store keyed collection of values.
There exist a special data structure named Array, to store ordered collections.


Arrays are a fundamental data structure in JavaScript that allow you to store and organize a collection of items under a single variable name. They are versatile and dynamic, meaning they can hold various data types like numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.

There are two main ways to create arrays in Js:
1. Array literal: This is the most common and concise wat, using sqaure brackets [] to enclose a comma-seperated list of elements.
2. Array Constructor: While less common, you can also use the Array() constructor

Declaration:
let arr = new Array();
let arr = [];

const numberArray = [2, 4, 6, 8];

/* ARRAY OF STRINGS */
