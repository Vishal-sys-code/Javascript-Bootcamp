We are encountering a TypeScript warning about using the variable name `name`, which is deprecated. This warning arises because `name` is a reserved keyword in JavaScript/TypeScript, and using it as a variable name can lead to unintended consequences or conflicts.

To resolve this warning, you should avoid using name as a variable `name`. Instead, you can use a different name that is not reserved.
